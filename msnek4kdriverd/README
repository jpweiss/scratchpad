Note to Developers (and others interested in the source code):

    All ChangeLog entries use the revision numbers from my local
    source code repository.

    I try to keep this project's Subversion repository on Sourceforge
    closely "in-sync" with my local one.  That is, use a shell script
    to auto-patch my local Sourceforge-working-directory with each
    commit to my local repository.  I then commit those patched
    changes using the same log entry from the local repos.  So, only
    the revision numbers differ between the two repositories.

    Occasionally, there will also be changes to only the Sourceforge
    repository.  So, the sequence of revision changes in my local
    repository won't completely match the ones you'll be able to see
    on Sourceforge.
