	* [r2172] ChangeLog:
	  - Updated this file with v1.0.0 pre-release bugfixes.

2011-05-18 18:26  John Weiss

	* [r2171] debian/changelog, debian/postinst, debian/prerm,
	  msnek4k-driverd.spec, pkgTemplates/debian.postinst.in,
	  pkgTemplates/msnek4k-driverd.spec.in, src/Makefile.am,
	  src/Makefile.in:
	  - Bugfix:  New file, "Timer.h", not added to the source package.
	  - Added status messages to the package install/remove scriptlets.
	    Not only tracks what's going on for users, but aids debugging
	    the packages themselves.
	  - Wrong version number on the debian package.

2011-05-17 20:48  John Weiss

	* [r2170] ChangeLog, README:
	  - Removed the boilerplate from the README and added a note for
	    developers and anyone else interested in (a) the SF source
	    code repository; (b) the ChangeLog.

2011-05-17 20:23  John Weiss

	* [r2169] ChangeLog, configure, debian/changelog,
	  msnek4k-driverd.spec, pkgTemplates/msnek4k-driverd.spec.in:
	  - Updates to changelogs and version numbers, in preparation for
	    the v1.0.0 release.

2011-05-17 19:24  John Weiss

	* [r2168] ChangeLog, configure.ac:
	  - Updates to this file.
	  - Preparation for the v1.0.0 release.

2011-05-17 18:53  John Weiss

	* [r2166] ChangeLog, aclocal.m4, ax_jpwTools.m4, config.h.in,
	  configure, configure.ac, debian/control, msnek4k-driverd.spec,
	  pkgTemplates/debian.control.in,
	  pkgTemplates/msnek4k-driverd.spec.in, src/Makefile.am,
	  src/Makefile.in, src/msnek4k_driverd.cc:
	  - Cosmetic fixups to the ChangeLog.
	  - Updates to autoconf-, automake-, and configure-generated
	    files.
	  - New Autoconf macros added, mainly around static linking
	    support.
	  - Now statically-linking the boost::program_options library,
	    eliminating a runtime dependency from the *.rpm and *.deb
	    packages.
	  - In "ReloadableProgramOptions_Base", renamed
	    'handleAnyRequiredReparse()' to 'reparseIfPending()', which
	    makes a bit more sense from a code-readability-perspective.

2011-05-04 11:04  John Weiss

	* [r2149] ChangeLog, src/LinuxInputDevice.cc,
	  src/LinuxInputDevice.h, src/Timer.h, src/msnek4k_driverd.cc:
	  - Modified the main loop:  Now uses polling to check if there is
	    data on the kbd device.  By polling and timing out
	    periodically, msnek4k_driverd can "remain active" w/o
	    consuming much CPU.  This, in turn, makes msnek4k_driverd more
	    responsive after long periods of inactivity.
	    .
	    The call to 'poll' has a timeout 2 times the X keyboard
	    auto-repeat activation delay, (A) making it tunable, and (B)
	    giving it a responsiveness close to (but slower than) X
	    keyboard repeat.

2011-02-10 17:25  John Weiss

	* [r2115] ChangeLog, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, Makefile,
	  debian/rules
	  - Packaging bugfixes.

2011-02-10 16:00  John Weiss

	* [r2114] ChangeLog, manpage/Makefile.am, manpage/Makefile.in,
	  manpage/msnek4k_driverd.1, manpage/msnek4k_driverd.lyx,
	  manpage/msnek4k_driverd.sgml, msnek4k-driverd.spec
	  - Added a "newbie" subsection to the EXAMPLES section of the
	    manpage.  Reorganized the EXAMPLES section, as well.
	  - Enhanced the manpage-Makefile to deal with a misfeature in
	    docbook2man (it forcibly uppercases the text in subsection
	    headings, which is not what I want).

2011-02-09 16:20  John Weiss

	* [r2113] ChangeLog, Doxygen, doxygen.tags
	  - Doxygen now using short-filenames (the long ones caused problems
	    with 'tar').

2011-02-09 16:15  John Weiss

	* [r2112] ChangeLog, TODO, configure.ac, configure,
	  debian/changelog, doxygen.tags, msnek4k-driverd.spec,
	  pkgTemplates/msnek4k-driverd.spec.in, src/Makefile.in
	  - Updates to this file.
	  - Preparation for v0.9.0 release.
	  - Updated:  Autoconf files.
	  - Fixed Postinstall/Preremove scriptlets in the RPM specfile.

2011-02-04 02:08  John Weiss

	* [r2109] TODO, make.syscfg.mk, src/Any.cc, src/Any.h,
	  src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in, src/msnek4k_driverd.cc:
	  - Added "Any.*" files, containing tools for printing out a
	    boost::any without runtime knowledge of the stored type.
	  - More reorganization & redesign of 'ProgramOptions_Base' and
	    'ReloadableProgramOptions_Base'.
	  - Added:  Package Postinstall/Preremove Scripts
	    + Will start the daemon on package install, restart on upgrade,
	      and stop on removal.
	    + Updated manpage accordingly.
	  - validateParsedOptions() calls print_variables_map() when
	    verbosity is 3 or larger.
	  - Removed the inactivity-wait, since the read from the kbd event
	    device blocks.
	  - Now correctly reparsing the configfile.
	    + Had to add the ability to "notify" the
	      boost::program_options::variables_map in parse_cfgfile().
	      Otherwise, configfile reparsing doesn't always work.
	  - Doxygen tweaks:
	    + Escaped some sensitive characters in the doxycomments (as
	      per the Doxygen manual).
	    + Now generating a graphical class heirarchy, collaboration
	      graph, and call/caller graph.

2011-01-24 01:33  John Weiss

	* [r2104] Doxyfile, TODO, ax_jpwTools.m4, configure, configure.ac,

	  debian/rules, doxygen.tags, manpage/Makefile.am,
	  manpage/Makefile.in, manpage/msnek4k_driverd.1,
	  manpage/msnek4k_driverd.lyx, manpage/msnek4k_driverd.sgml,
	  msnek4k-driverd.spec, pkgTemplates/debian.postinst.in,
	  pkgTemplates/msnek4k-driverd.spec.in, src/msnek4k_driverd.cc:
	  - ProgramOptions_Base changed and reorganized:
	    + C'tor is now a protected member.
	    + Now has a subclass, "ReloadableProgramOptions_Base";
	      implements configfile reloading on a c'tor-specified
	      signal.
	  - Fine-tuning some of the Doxygen settings.
	  - New Feature:  Configfile Reload on SIGUSR1
	    + Updated src to use ReloadableProgramOptions_Base
	    + Updated manpage accordingly.
	  - Added:  Package Postinstall/Preremove Scripts
	    + Will start the daemon on package install, restart on upgrade,
	      and stop on removal.
	    + Updated manpage accordingly.
	  - Bugfixes to:
	    + Manpage Makefile
	    + Custom Autoconf macro
	  - Autoconf/Automake updates.

	  - Preparation for v0.8.1 release.
	  - Updated:  Autoconf files.
	  - New:
	    + Binary is now installed suid-root.
	    + Binary drops root privileges when no longer needed.
	    + Rudimentary tests performed.

2010-12-30 23:18  John Weiss

	* [r2089] configure, src/Makefile.in:

	  src/LinuxInputEvent.h, src/X11Display.h, src/msnek4k_driverd.cc:
	  - Updating copyright years.

2010-12-15 23:36  John Weiss

	  - Minor bugfixes.

2010-12-14 22:25  John Weiss

	* [r2081] ChangeLog, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, configure,
	  debian/changelog, manpage/Makefile.am, manpage/Makefile.in,
	  msnek4k-driverd.spec, pkgTemplates/msnek4k-driverd.spec.in:
	  - Updated the ChangeLog with this message.
	  - Packaging files updated:
	    + RPM specfile(s)
	    + DEB changelog
	    + The bindist package name now includes the version number.
	  - Autoconf updates.

2010-12-12 03:00  John Weiss

	* [r2079] TODO, ax_jpwTools.m4, config.h.in, configure,
	  configure.ac, debian/docs, manpage/Makefile.am,
	  manpage/Makefile.in, manpage/docbook-refentry.layout,
	  manpage/msnek4k_driverd.1, manpage/msnek4k_driverd.lyx,
	  manpage/msnek4k_driverd.sgml, src/msnek4k_driverd.cc:
	  - BUGFIX:
	    + X11 kept terminating "msnek4k_driverd" whenever the latter
	      received an unknown scancode ... unless "msnek4k_driverd" ran
	      in verbose mode.
	    + An incorrectly-constructed if-statement was the cause.  It's
	      now been fixed and the bug has been eliminated.
	  - Crude sighandling added.
	  - Checks and Warnings for inconsistent settings added.
	  - There is now a manpage.
	    + Much of the extra explanatory material in the "usage" message
	      moved to the manpage.
	  - The binary now accepts a "--version" option, printing out the
	    version as defined in "config.h"
	  - New Autoconf function to "export" a variable to the "config.h"
	    file.
	  - Configuration File Default Location:
	    + Now exporting the "sysconf" configuration path to "config.h".
	    + The value of "sysconf" is now used as the base directory for
	      the config file.
	  - The "examples/msnek4k_driverd.conf" is being compressed when
	    packaged into a *.deb.  Modified "debian/docs" in an attempt to
	    change this.  It may not work.

2010-11-18 16:55  John Weiss

	* [r2075] Makefile.am, Makefile.in, configure, configure.ac,
	  manpage, manpage/Makefile.am, manpage/Makefile.in,
	  manpage/msnek4k_driverd.lyx, manpage/msnek4k_driverd.sgml:
	  - Initial Commit:  Adding manpage and autoconf/automake support
	    for it.

2010-11-16 17:28  John Weiss

	* [r2073] Makefile.am, Makefile.in, configure, debian/changelog,
	  msnek4k-driverd.spec, pkgTemplates/msnek4k-driverd.spec.in:
	  - Changes to get RPM builds working.

2010-11-16 02:16  John Weiss

	* [r2072] ax_jpwTools.m4, configure.ac:
	  - Changes to AX_JPW_CREATING_DEB_RPM.
	    + It now takes 3 args, the first being the directory containing
	      the files listed in the other two.  It's required, anyhow, that
	      they the *.in files be in a directory different from their
	      installation targets.
	    + Removed debugging commands.

2010-11-16 01:54  John Weiss

	* [r2070] AUTHORS, ChangeLog, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, NEWS,
	  README, ax_jpwTools.m4, config.guess, config.sub, configure,
	  configure.ac, debian/changelog, debian/control,
	  debian/control.in[DEL], msnek4k-driverd.spec.in[DEL],
	  pkgTemplates, pkgTemplates/debian.control.in[CPY],
	  pkgTemplates/msnek4k-driverd.spec.in[CPY], src/Makefile.in:
	  - Adding the Automake-required files (they were symlinks before).
	  - Fixed:  'debian/control' and 'msnek4k-driverd.spec' no longer
	    erased by the 'distclean' rule
	    + The debian/control.in and *.spec.in files moved to a new
	      directory, 'pkgTemplates/'.
	    + Autoconf changes (see below).
	  - Autoconf Changes:
	    + Added some of the files generated by 'dpkg_buildpackage' to
	      the CLEANFILES macro.
	    + All indentation 'ax_jpwTools.m4' changed to 2 spaces.
	    + New macro for specifying packaging-system files (*.in files)
	      to be created by 'configure'.
	    + Cleanup of defunct rules and variables.
	  - Packaging Improvements:
	    + Added an Autoconf file "debian/control.in" for Debian
	      packages.  The "debian/control" file is now generated by
	      Autoconf.
	    + Added an Autoconf RPM specfile.
	      · The actual specfile will be generated by Autoconf.
	      · This is the initial instance of an RPM specfile.
	    + Added "bindist" rules so that I can generate binaries while
	      getting the RPM and Debian packages to work correctly.
	    + Adding the symlinks to config.guess and config.sub, which are
	      also now part of the source distribution.
	  - Debian Changelog modified to:
	    + ...add v0.7.1;
	    + ...cut the v0.7.2 release.

2010-11-15 18:00  John Weiss

	* [r2067] COPYING, LICENSE, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, TODO,
	  WARRANTY, configure, configure.ac, debian/control,
	  debian/control.in, debian/rules, examples/msnek4k_driverd.conf,
	  msnek4k-driverd.spec, msnek4k-driverd.spec.in, src/Makefile.am,
	  src/Makefile.in:
	  - Copyright File Changeover:
	    - COPYING is now the distributed file; LICENSE is now the
	      symlink.
	  - Packaging Improvements:
	    + Added an Autoconf file "debian/control.in" for Debian
	      packages. The "debian/control" file is now generated by
	      Autoconf.
	    + Added an Autoconf RPM specfile.
	      · The actual specfile will be generated by Autoconf.
	      · This is the initial instance of an RPM specfile.
	    + Added "bindist" rules so that I can generate binaries while
	      getting the RPM and Debian packages to work correctly.
	  - Changed my name in the WARRANTY and other std. files.
	  - Autoconf Changes:
	    + New Makefile variable, ETC_X11_PATH
	    + The default for the XSESSIOND_PATH variable now uses
	      ETC_X11_PATH.
	    + There's now a separate tarball name, replacing the '_' with a
	      '-'.
	    + Cleanup of defunct rules and variables.
	  - Configfile changes:
	    + Now has "sane defaults" matching those in the *.xmodmap file.
	    + The *.xmodmap file is now installed.

2010-11-15 17:57  John Weiss

	* [r2066] COPYING[DEL]:
	  - Removing the symlink, in preparation for changing it to an
	    actual file (namely, the one it used to link to).

2010-11-12 01:20  John Weiss

	* [r2063] Makefile.am, Makefile.in, configure, configure.ac,
	  debian, debian/changelog, debian/compat, debian/control,
	  debian/copyright, debian/docs, debian/rules, src/Makefile.am,
	  src/Makefile.in:
	  - Bugfixes to the Makefile.am
	  - Changes to how the Xsession.d startup script is built and
	     installed.
	  - Initial version of the debian control files.

2010-11-10 18:52  John Weiss

	* [r2062] Makefile.in, TODO, ax_jpwTools.m4, configure,
	  configure.ac, make.syscfg.mk, src/90x11-msnek4k_driverd.in,
	  src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in:
	  - New custom autoconf macros:
	    + Macro that provides a default value for custom 'configure'
	      variables.
	    + Syntactic sugar for AC_ARG_VAR that provides a default value
	      for the newly-defined Makefile.in variable.
	  - New:  shell script fragment for starting the daemon from the
	    "/etc/X11/XSession.d" path.

2010-11-09 19:59  John Weiss

	* [r2061] config.h.in, examples/msnek4k_driverd.conf,
	  make.syscfg.mk[CPY], src/LinuxInputDevice.cc,
	  src/LinuxInputDevice.h, src/LinuxInputEvent.cc,
	  src/LinuxInputEvent.h, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in,
	  src/msnek4k_driverd.cc:
	  - Updates to autoconf-generated changes in the *.in files.
	    + New file, "make.syscfg.mk", contains Makefile variables for
	      easily changing from a debug-build to a regression build to an
	      optimized build.  It also contains variables for tuning the
	      build to a specific platform.  This new file is "include"d
	      into any "Makefile.am" that actually builds code.
	  - More doxycomments added.
	  - Replaced "enum event_type" with integer constants.
	    + The new integer constant variables are defined in a new file,
	      LinuxInputEvent.cc, using the macros from the "linux/input.h"
	      header.
	    + Doing so in a translation unit decouples "linux/input.h" from
	      the "LinuxInputEvent.h" header.  Which, in turn, decouples it
	      from all of the other source files.
	  - New Feature:  kbd-dev = auto
	    + Searches the "/dev/input" directory for all "event?" files.
	    + Examines the files for a match to a USB vendor ID and product
	      ID.
	    + If the ID match fails, fall back to matching the displayname
	      to a given string.
	    + Once found, perform a final match against a list of required
	      and forbidden features that the device must have in order to
	      work.
	    + Can still explicitly specify a device via "kbd-dev", of
	      course.
	  - Code Refactored for the recent changes in
	    "ProgramOptions_Base".
	  - FIXED:  The "--dbg" option was broken.

2010-11-03 14:11  John Weiss

	* [r2057] Makefile.in, ax_jpwTools.m4, configure, configure.ac,
	  src/LinuxInputDevice.cc, src/LinuxInputDevice.h[CPY],
	  src/LinuxInputEvent.h[CPY], src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in,
	  src/X11Display.h[CPY], src/msnek4k_driverd.cc:
	  - Autoconf:
	    + Renamedthe AX_JPW_NO_USR_ETC macro to
	      AX_JPW_USE_FHS_DEFAULTS.
	    + AX_JPW_USE_FHS_DEFAULTS now implemented in a fashion similar
	      to a "use the Linux FHS" macro that I found online.
	  - Several classes split out of msnek4k_driverd.cc into their own
	    files.
	  - Renamed Classes:
	    + UnixInputFd -> LinuxInputDevice
	    + KbdInputEvent -> LinuxInputEvent
	  - Removed some unused "#include"s.

2010-10-28 03:15  John Weiss

	* [r2055] TODO, ax_jpwTools.m4[CPY], configure, configure.ac:
	  - Custom macros split out of 'configure.ac' into new file,
	    'ax_jpwTools.m4'.
	  - New feature:  C++ header checks (finally!)
	  - New feature:  Use "/etc" as the sysconfdir, not "/usr/etc" when
	    prefix=="/usr".

2010-10-26 23:10  John Weiss

	* [r2054] src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in, src/msnek4k_driverd.cc:
	  - Changed the SVN Keyword, from the old CVS-specific "RCS $Id:"
	    to "$Id:".
	  - Commented out "-Winline"; it generated too many warnings.
	  - Renamed a fn. arg that was shadowing a member.

2010-10-26 21:54  John Weiss

	* [r2035] configure, src/Makefile.in:
	  - Updated from the build.

2010-10-26 21:53  John Weiss

	* [r2034] Makefile.am, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am:
	  - Updated the Subversion keyword tags.  Hopefully, 'svn' will
	    find them this time.

2010-10-26 21:30  John Weiss

	* [r2032] Makefile.in, TODO, aclocal.m4, config.h.in, configure,
	  configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in,
	  src/msnek4k_driverd.cc:
	  - Restored "config.h.in"; without it, the cmdline for the
	    compiler is bloated with cpp-define flags.
	  - Renamed the package tarname to match what's used in the
	    Sourceforge project.
	  - Removed AC_COMPILE_WARNINGS, since it was adding the
	    "-pendantic" option to the compiler flags vars.  And
	    "-pedantic" warns about things that are actually valid C++
	    syntax.
	  - Added AM_CFLAGS and AM_CXXFLAGS variables to handle my custom
	    compiler settings.
	  - Program changes:
	    + errno.h => cerrno
	    + Removed defunct class, DisplayMapper.
	    + Now using Unicode character entities in my strings, rather
	      than hardcoding in UTF-8 or Latin-1.
	    + Handled a few compiler warnings.

2010-10-24 19:17  John Weiss

	* [r2031] Makefile.am, Makefile.in, WARRANTY, configure,
	  configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in:
	  - Had to remove AC_CHECK_HEADERS for C++ header files.  The check
	    is done with the C compiler, and there's no equivalent macro that
	    does C++.
	  - Added lists of install files for the default configfile and the
	    "*/share/doc/*" files.
	  - Bugfixes in the autoconf files.

2010-10-24 18:23  John Weiss

	* [r2030] Makefile.in, config.h.in[DEL], configure, configure.ac,
	  src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in:
	  - Fleshed out "configure.ac" with some custom m4 macros to abort
	    if a feature is missing.  Also added some "action-if-error"
	    args to some of the existing checks.
	  - No longer creating a config.h

2010-10-23 04:28  John Weiss

	* [r2029] COPYING, INSTALL, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4,
	  config.h.in, configure, configure.ac, depcomp, install-sh,
	  missing, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in:
	  - Now using Autoconf & Automake as the build system.  Adding:
