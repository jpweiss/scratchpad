Description: A driver for the MS Natural Ergo Keyboard 4000
There are 3 keys on the Microsoft Natural© Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 which the
linux kernel cannot handle (yet):
   The "Spell" function key
   Zoom-Up
   Zoom-Down

This is a daemon which listens on a "/dev/input/event*" device for scancodes
from those 3 keys and generates X11 keycodes for them using the XTest
extension.  You can also map the Zoom keys to mouse-button events (say, to
turn the Zoom-jog into a scroll-wheel).
