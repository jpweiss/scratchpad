# This is the configuration file for "pkgBackup.pl".  You can omit any of the
# entries below, as the script contains builtin, sane defaults.  (These sane
# defaults are what the out-of-the-box version of this file contains.)  So, if
# you want to trim down this file, you can safely delete parameters that you
# leave unchanged from their default settings.
#
# Parameter names and values are separated by either a '=' or ':'.  You can
# put any amount of whitespace around these delimiters.
#
# List parameters begin with a lone '(' in place of the value and end with a
# lone ')' on a separate line.  The list items occupy the lines in-between,
# one item per line.  You can indent the items by any amount of whitespace.
#
# Parameter values *can* contain embedded whitespace.  They can't begin or end
# in whitespace, however.  (This goes for list items too.)

# The working directory used by "pkgBackup.pl".  The Master Lists are stored
# here.
#
# If unset (i.e. only whitespace follows the '='), the value of
# "Archive_Destination_Dir" is used in its place.
#
# NOTE:  Deleting this option entirely (or commenting it out) doesn't unset
#        it.  You'll end up using the hardcoded, default value instead, which
#        is probably not what you want.

# A package's "install time" may actually be recorded *before* all of the
# files have been unarchived from the package.  So, you would have package
# member files whose date is several seconds older than the package's install
# time.  Although this program tries to estimate the installation completion
# time, you could still have unchanged files that always show up in the backup
# archive, especially for really large RPM/DEB packages.
#
# You can "flex" each package's (possibly estimated) installation-completion
# time forward by the amount given in this option.  The value is in seconds,
# and must be in the range [0, 300] inclusive.  Useful values are 0, 10, and
# 30.  Using a value larger than 60 (1 minute) is legal, but not a very good
# idea.

#
# You can use regexps in the elements of this list.  I suggest, however, that
# you stick with simple regexps, so that you spend your time backing up your
# system instead of debugging your configuration file!  Stick to ".*"
# expressions and simple groupings.  Use "(?:x|y|z)" in place of "(x|y|z)" for
# grouping things, as the "(?: )" syntax is a Perl optimization and will run
# faster.
#
# NOTE:  These MUST BE directories installed by one or more RPM packages.
#        They are ONLY used during the scan of modified RPM-member files.

# directories in this list; however, that has not been tested.)
#
# PLEASE DO *NOT* put "/home" in this list:
# - This program is designed for backing up your system customizations, not
#   users' home directories.
# - It's better to backup "/home" separately from the rest of the system, on a
#   different schedule.
# - There may be files in "/home" that don't change much (family photo scans,
#   USENET news articles you like, your MP3 collection, Quicktime movies,
#   porn, custom *.rpm/*.deb packages) but you're leaving on-disk for
#   convenience.  You (should) burn these files to DVD/CD not long after
#   download, or when you have enough collected.
#   Clearly, you're not interested in backing up these files on a regular
#   basis; there's no need.
#
# For the files in "/home" that *do* change frequently, I suggest using one of
# the standard backup tools (taper, kdat, tar) and archiving to a file.
