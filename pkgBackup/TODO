- "install.sh" does not handle cron installations without an
  /etc/cron.{weekly,monthly}.  For these installations, it would be
  very nice to add two lines to the global 'crontab' file.
  As a first-draft, I could add a sample 'crontab' file, or sample
  'crontab' entries/cmds to the documentation.

- Could also change the permission/ownership/symlink restoration
  scripts so that changes which do nothing don't execute.  Or not...

- Put together some archiver scripts that use GNU-tar's backup
  facilities, as an example of how to do a trivial backup of user
  files.
