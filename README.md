# Overview #

This repository contains the source-code of my SourceForge projects:

* msnek4kdriverd
  - The `msnek4kDriverDaemon`, an X11-based driver for the handful of
    keys on the "Microsoft Natural® Ergonomic Keyboard 4000" that
    aren't supported by the Linux kernel.
  - Written in C++
  - http://sourceforge.net/projects/msnek4kdriverd/

* pkgBackup
  - Back up your `*.rpm`- or `*.deb`-based system by only saving the
    *changes* you've made to the files installed from a package.
    You're already backing up your packages, so why back up the same
    files twice?
  - Written in Perl.
  - http://sourceforge.net/projects/pkgbackup/

* mrtgAddons4Dsl
  - Perl scripts and configuration files for MRTG.
    Both scripts provide information about a home DSL modem (which
    usually doesn't have an SNMP agent in it).
  - http://sourceforge.net/projects/mrtgaddons4dsl/

* tp-x40-tools
  - ThinkPad X40 Tools.  This is the least-complete of my SourceForge
    projects.
  - http://sourceforge.net/projects/tp-x40-tools/
